            The history of the automobile is a long and complex set of events. The question of who invented the first car is still a very hot topic for debate right now. So, here is a set of events that I consider are very important throughout the timeline of the automobile history.
    </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>1335 -</strong><br></p>
    This is the first “car” idea ever imagined. Dutchman Guido von Vigevano sketched a model called the “Windwagen”. It is a car powered by wind by spinning windmill sails. This design is considered the first car because it had an engine, the spinning windmill sails, it had gears to transfer power and it had wheels.

            <p>
                <strong>1478 -</strong><br><br>
    Leonardo da Vinci also sketched some designs of a clockwork car. The car is to work like clocks, using a set of gears and springs to power the wheels.

        <p><strong>1769 -</strong><br><br>
    Most Historians agree that Nicholas Joseph Cugnot is the first person to build a self propelled vehicle in France. This was after the steam engine was invented. The vehicle is a tractor for the French Army, it had 3 wheels and moves at about 3 miles per hour. The steam wagon was heavy and hard to steer. In fact, 2 years later, he crashed into a wall with the vehicle and was thrown into Jail.


        <p><strong>1789 -</strong><br><br>
    American Oliver Evans got his patent for a steam-powered land vehicle.


        <h3>Late 17th century -
            Christiaan Huygens, the person who invented many things, came up with the idea of powering an engine by exploding gun powder in a tube. However, he did not live to see his idea being used because engineering was not as advanced at that time.
        </h3>

        <p><strong>1863 -</strong><br><br>
    Joseph Étienne Lenoir invented the spark plug. He was one of the engineers that took Huygens’ ideas and made them happen. Making the gas explode with a spark of electricity was what Lenoir was working with. This later is used in the ignition of a car.


        <p><strong>1876 -</strong><br><br>
    Nikolaus August Otto came up with a gasoline engine in 1876. Lenoir died in poverty because although gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, it is becoming obsolete. Nikolaus August Otto soon discovered that gasoline is a lot more effective than gas as it is safer and more practical.


        <p><strong>1885 -</strong><br><br>
    Karl Benz, the starter of the Company Benz built the first practical gas powered car in the world. At first, nobody really paid much attention to Benz’s new car, until one day, his wife and his two sons took a 100 km journey to see the grandma, the car had to be pushed up during uphills and they also had to buy fuel at chemist shops, this go a lot of attention. His wife gave Karl the suggestion to use gears for uphill and this made the car a lot more effective. Soon, Benz was becoming a lot more successful and became the world’s leading car maker.


        <p><strong>1886 -</strong><br><br>
    In Michigan, Henry Ford builds his first automobile.


        <p><strong>1893 -</strong><br><br>
    In 1893, the first prototype of the diesel engine was created. Also known as the compression-ignition engine, the diesel engine’s advantage is that it can literally work with any kind of fuel. This is also why he is a pioneer in the field of bio fuel.


        <p><strong>1900 -</strong><br><br>
    The steering wheel is designed to replace the steering tiller.


        <p><strong>1913 -</strong><br><br>
    The assembly line increased the production speed of Henry Ford’s company from 7.5 cars per hour to 146 cars per hour. This is an innovation in the manufacturing of cars.


        <p><strong>1940 -</strong><br><br>
    In the world wars, US designed a four wheel all purpose vehicle that benefitted them in the war, also known as the jeep.


        <p><strong>1995 -</strong><br><br>
    The Global Positioning System is introduced, also known as the GPS.
